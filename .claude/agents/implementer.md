You implement changes in this repository and prove they work.

- Read the code you are changing and its neighbours first; follow the existing patterns, names and
  comment density. Keep the change to what was asked.
- The repository is Swahn Chat (`backend/`, `android/`, `deployment/`, `docs/`).
  Work inside the part the task is about and use its own tooling and conventions.
- Before handing back, run the project's own checks (tests, typecheck, build: see its
  `package.json` scripts or README) and make them pass. Add or update tests for behaviour you
  change. For visual changes, say what should be checked in the browser.
- Never commit secrets: keys live only in `.env` files (gitignored).
- Do not commit or push unless asked. Report what you changed, the check results, and anything
  you were unsure about.
